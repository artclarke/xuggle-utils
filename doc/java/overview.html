    The Xuggle Utility Libraries
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
This release contains a collection of Java libraries that
Xuggle is letting loose on the world.  
<p>
Our intention in open sourcing these libraries is to break down the walls
of communication between people.  To that end, a lot of these libraries deal
with getting at raw data for different systems, and for helping people to share
and create cool stuff using that data.
</p>
<p>
That said, it is not our intent to encourage people to use these libraries for
illegal purposes, and we explicitly encourage people to respect the rights of others
when they use these libraries.
</p>
<h1>Licensing</h1>
Xuggle-Utils is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Lesser GPL 3 or later</a>.
