    The Xuggle Utility Libraries
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
This release contains a collection of Java libraries that
Xuggle is letting loose on the world.  
<p>
Our intention in open sourcing these libraries is to break down the walls
of communication between people.  To that end, a lot of these libraries deal
with getting at raw data for different systems, and for helping people to share
and create cool stuff using that data.
</p>
<p>
That said, it is not our intent to encourage people to use these libraries for
illegal purposes, and we explicitly encourage people to respect the rights of others
when they use these libraries.
</p>
<h1>Licensing</h1>
All Xuggle Open Source Libraries are released either under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">Lesser GPL 2.1 or later</a>
or under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL 2.0 or later</a>.
See the COPYING file in each library for details.
<p>
We generally prefer the LGPL, but sometimes we
are required to release under GPL (for example, use of FFMPEG's libswscale library requires
the use of the GPL, so if you want to access the com::xuggle::xuggler::IVideoResampler object in the Xuggler library,
you need to compile a GPL version).  In these cases, we still try to provide a reduced functionality
LGPL license if possible.
