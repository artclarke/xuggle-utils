= What is Xuggle-Utils ? =

Xuggle-Utils is a collection of utility classes that Xuggle
has decided to open-source.  We use these classes extensively
in our closed-source code.

Examples of classes found here are a Decoupled Event Dispatching
model (similar to ActionScript's EventDispatcher model), and
a State Machine implementation.
